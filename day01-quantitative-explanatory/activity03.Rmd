In the last activity, you might have noticed that I made this Rmd output a document with a type of `github_document` (in the YAML header underneath the title - on line 3) instead of a HTML, Word, or PDF document.
This produces a GitHub friendly Markdown file that GitHub then renders to HTML.
You can read more about this output type in RMarkdown's [documentation page](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/github_document_format.html) if you want to learn more.

# Day 1

## Load the necessary packages

I encourage you to continue using the two packages from Posit (formerly [RStudio](https://posit.co/)): `{tidyverse}` and `{tidymodels}`.
Remember that [Emil Hvitfeldt](https://www.emilhvitfeldt.com/) (of Posit) has put together a [complementary online text](https://emilhvitfeldt.github.io/ISLR-tidymodels-labs/index.html) for the labs in the *ISLR* text that utilize `{tidyverse}` and `{tidymodels}` instead of base R.

-   In the **Packages** pane of RStudio, check if `{tidyverse}` and `{tidymodels}` are installed.
    Be sure to check both your **User Library** and **System Library**.

-   If either of these are not currently listed (they should be because you verified this in Activity 1), type the following in your **Console** pane, replacing `package_name` with the appropriate name, and press Enter/Return afterwards.

    ```{r  eval = FALSE}
    install.packages("package_name")
    ```

-   Once you have verified that both `{tidyverse}` and `{tidymodels}` are installed (in either your user or system library), load these packages in the R chunk below titled `load-packages`.

-   Run the `load-packages` code chunk or **knit** <img src="../README-img/knit-icon.png" alt="knit" width="20"/> icon your Rmd document to verify that no errors occur.

```{r load-packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(skimr)
library(GGally)
```

Since we will be looking at many relationships graphically, it will be nice to not have to code each of these individually.
`{GGally}` is an extension to `{ggplot2}` that reduces some of the complexities when combining multiple plots.
For example, [`GGally::ggpairs`](http://ggobi.github.io/ggally/articles/ggpairs.html) is very handy for pairwise comparisons of multiple variables.

-   In the **Packages** pane of RStudio, check if `{GGally}` is already installed.
    Be sure to check both your **User Library** and **System Library**.

-   If this is not currently listed, type the following in your **Console** pane and press Enter/Return afterwards.

    ```{r  eval = FALSE}
    install.packages("GGally")
    ```

-   Once you have verified that `{GGally}` is installed, load it in the R chunk titled `load-packages`.

-   Run the `setup` code chunk or **knit** <img src="../README-img/knit-icon.png" alt="knit" width="20"/> icon your Rmd document to verify that no errors occur.

## Load the data and

I found a way to upload data from OpenIntro without needing to download it first!
Recall that data we are working with is from the OpenIntro site (its "about" page: <https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=hfi>).
We can access the raw data from their tab-delimited text file link: <https://www.openintro.org/data/tab-delimited/hfi.txt>.

Create a new R code chunk below that is titled `load-data` and reads in the above linked TSV (tab-separated values) file by doing the following:

```{r load-data}
hfi <- read_csv("hfi.csv")
hfi_2016 <- hfi %>% filter(year == 2016)
head(hfi_2016)
```

-   Rather than downloading this file, uploading to RStudio, then reading it in, explore how to load this file directly from the provided URL with `readr::read_tsv` (`{readr}` is part of `{tidyverse}`).

-   Assign this data set into a data frame named `hfi` (short for "Human Freedom Index").
    IGNORE THIS ABOVE NOTE

-   Filter the data `hfi` data frame for year 2016 and assigns the result to an R data object named `hfi_2016`.
    You will use `hfi_2016` for the remainder of this activity.

We will continue using personal freedom scores, `pf_score`, as the response variable and build on our model that had `pf_expression_control` as the explanatory variable.

Create a new R code chunk below, with an appropriate title, that does the following:

-   Review the about page of the data set and select at least one additional numeric variables (hint: look for `<dbl>` or `<int>` designations) to describe its distribution. Remember to write your description.
-   You may also wish to do this for `pf_score` and `pf_expression_control` again to help you remember what you noticed last week.

```{r explore-data}
skim(hfi_2016)
hfi_2016 <- hfi_2016 %>% select(pf_score,pf_expression_control,pf_ss_homicide,region)
hfi_2016

#quickly check out distribution of this new col, pf_ss_homicide
ggplot(hfi_2016, aes(x = pf_ss_homicide)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .5, fill = "blue", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of pf_ss_homicide",
       x = "pf_ss_homicide",
       y = "Frequency")

ggplot(hfi_2016, aes(y = pf_ss_homicide)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of pf_ss_homicide")
```

-   pf_score has a left-skewed distribution (peak farther from zero, over to right).
    It has a median of \~7 and half of the rows is between 8 and 6.
    Two potential outliers around 2.5 but nothing unusual about these scores.
    The shape is peaky and bimodal, one peak around the median and another around 9.

-   pf_expression_control has no outliers and is not skewed.
    It is roughly unimodal and pretty evenly distributed about the median near 5.

**- pf_ss_homicide has a far left skew, with the upper 50% of values above 9 or so. There is one outlier around 0.**

## Pairwise relationships

In Activity 2 you explored simple linear regression models.
Specifically, you fit and assessed this relationship:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times x + \varepsilon
$$

![check-in](../README-img/noun-magnifying-glass.png) **Check in**

Review how you described this model in Activity 2.
- What were your parameter estimates (i.e., the $\beta$s)?
How did you interpret these and what did they imply for this scenario?
- How good of a fit was this model?
What did you use to assess this?

For this activity, we will begin using the two other quantitative variables to describe the patterns in the response variable.
Take a moment to think about what this previous sentence means:

-   What does this mean from a statistical point of view?
-   What does this mean from a "real world" point of view (i.e., for your data's situation)?

Now, we will obtain graphical and numerical summaries to describe the pairwise relationships.

-   In the code chunk below titled `pairs-plot`, replace "verbatim" with "r" just before the code chunk title.
-   Replace `explanatory` in the `select` line with the variable you identified above (I did this above in the explore-data code chunk)
-   Run your code chunk or knit your document.

```{r pairs-plot,warning = FALSE}
hfi_2016 %>% 
  ggpairs()
```

Note that a warning message (really a list of warning messages) might display in your **Console** and likely under your R code chunk when you knit this report.
In R, warning messages are not necessarily a bad thing and you should read these to make sure you understand what it is informing you of.
To suppress warning messages from displaying after this specific R code chunk when you knit your report, add the follow inside the curly brackets (`{r }`) at the top of your R code chunk (notice the preceding comma): `, warning=FALSE`.

Somewhat related... If you do not want all the messages `{tidyverse}` and `{tidymodels}` produce when you load them, you can add `, message=FALSE` to your `load-packages` R code chunk.

After running the `pairs-plot` code, answer the following questions:

1.  For each pair of variables, how would you describe the relationship graphically? Do any of the relationships look linear? Are there any interesting/odd features (outliers, non-linear patterns, etc.)?

**For pf_score and homicide,they seem to be no interesting patterns besides a subset of 0 scores on homicide. Those tend to be slightly higher pf_scores.**

2.  For each pair of variables, how would you describe the relationship numerically?

**weak correlations can be found, particularly between homicide and pf_score.**

3.  Are your two explanatory variables collinear (correlated)? Essentially, this means that adding more than one of these variables to the model would not add much value to the model. We will talk more on this issue in Activity 4 (other considerations in regression models).

**No, they are not collinear.**

## The multiple linear regression model

You will now fit the following model:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times x_1 + \beta_2 \times x_2 + \varepsilon
$$

-   In the code chunk below titled `mlr-model`, replace "verbatim" with "r" just before the code chunk title.
-   Replace `explanatory`, similarly to what you did in your `pairs-plot` R code chunk.
-   Run your code chunk or knit your document.

```{r mlr-model}
#fit the mlr model
lm_spec <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_mode("regression") %>%
  set_engine("lm")

lm_spec

mlr_mod <- lm_spec %>% 
fit(pf_score ~ pf_expression_control + pf_ss_homicide, data = hfi_2016)

# model output
tidy(mlr_mod)
```

After doing this, answer the following questions:

4.  Using your output, write the complete estimated equation for this model. Remember in Activity 2 that this looked like:

$$
\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 \times x_1
$$

where $b_0$ and $b_1$ were your model parameter estimates.
Note that your model here will be different (and have more terms).

$$
\hat{y} = 3.95 + .535 \times x_1 + .049 \times x_2
$$

5.  For each of the estimated parameters (the *y*-intercept and the slopes associated with each explanatory variable - three total), interpret these values in the context of this problem. That is, what do they mean for a "non-data" person?

**- The interpretation for the second slope (beta_2 or pf_ss_homicide) is: "For every 1 unit increase in pf_ss_homicide, there is an associated increase of, on average, .049... units of pf_score, holding all other values constant.**

## Challenge: 3-D plots

In *ISL*, the authors provided a 3-D scatterplot with a plane that represents the estimated model.
Do some internet sleuthing to minimally produce a 3-D scatterplot (you do not need to include the plane).
Ideally, this would be something that plays nicely with (looks similar to) `{ggplot2}`.

-   Create a new R code chunk, with a descriptive name, and add your code to create this plot.

```{r scatter-3d, eval = FALSE}
library(plotly)
scatter_plot <- plot_ly(hfi_2016,x = ~pf_score,y = ~pf_expression_control, z = ~pf_ss_homicide, mode )
scatter_plot
```

After doing this, respond to the following prompt:

6.  Compare your 3-D scatterplot and the `GGally::ggpairs` output. Comment on the strengths and weaknesses of these two visualizations. Do both display on GitHub when you push your work there?

**the output from ggpairs is preferrable in my opinion, since the 3D plot doesn't display on Github.**

# Day 2

During Day 1, you fit a model with one quantitative response variable and two quantitative explanatory variables.
Now we look at a model with one quantitative explanatory variable and one qualitative explanatory variable.
We will use the full 2016 dataset for this entire activity.
For the Mini-Competition next week, you will be instructed to use the train/test split process.

## Fitting the overall model

This is similar to what we have already been doing - fitting our desired model.
For today's activity, we will fit something like:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{qualitative\\_variable} + \beta_2 \times \text{quantitative\\_variable} + \varepsilon
$$

where $y$, $\text{qualitative\\_variable}$, and $\text{quantitative\\_variable}$ are from `hfi_2016`.
Note that the two explanatory variables can be entered in whatever order.

To help with interpretability, we will focus on qualitative predictor variables with only two levels.
Unfortunately, none of the current `chr` variables have only two levels.
Fortunately, we can create our own.

-   In the code chunk below titled `binary-pred`, replace "verbatim" with "r" just before the code chunk title.
-   Run your code chunk or knit your document.

```{r binary-pred}
hfi_2016 <- hfi_2016 %>%
  mutate(east_atlantic = if_else(
    region %in% c("North America", "Latin America & the Caribbean"),
    "No",
    "Yes"
  ))
```

7.  What is happening in the above code? What new variable did we create? How do you know it is new? What values does it take when?

**We have created a binary variable of east_atlantic which determines whether a region is in the east atlantic, which is defined by the mutate() function from dplyr. This function is used to create new cols as functions of existing variables. It takes "No" when the region for that country (row) is in NA/LatinAm/Carribean, and "Yes" otherwise.**

-   In the code chunk below titled `qual-mlr`, replace "verbatim" with "r" just before the code chunk title.
-   Run your code chunk or knit your document.

```{r qual-mlr}
# review any visual patterns
hfi_2016 %>% 
  select(pf_score, east_atlantic, pf_expression_control) %>% #pick out our variables of interest for correlation matrices
  ggpairs()

#create the mlr model object
lm_spec <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_mode("regression") %>%
  set_engine("lm")

#fit the mlr model to our data and predictors of interest
qual_mod <- lm_spec %>% 
  fit(pf_score ~ east_atlantic + pf_expression_control, data = hfi_2016)

# model output
tidy(qual_mod)
```

When looking at your `ggpairs` output, remember to ask yourself, "does it make sense to include all of these variables?" Specifically, if you notice that the response (predictor???) variables are highly correlated (collinear), including both does not necessarily add much value as they are essentially saying the same thing.
Note: There are more advanced methods to include the variability within a rater for our model - this is beyond STA 631.
If this sounds of interest to you, explore *generalized estimating equations* (GEE) or *generalized linear mixed models* (GLMM).
However, there are often times when we choose to include variables in our model because it is important to us - for various reasons.
Regardless, I encourage you to keep your readings of *DF* in mind - who will benefit by including this information; who will be hurt by including this information?

Also, when looking at your model (`tidy`) output, the `term` label for your qualitative explanatory variable look odd.
Answer the following questions:

8.  What is the label that R assigned to this explanatory variable `term`?

**- eastAtlanticYes is the label for our qualitative variable term.**

9.  What information is represented here?

**- This represents the coefficient estimate for countries where they ARE in the east atlantic region. Meaning that the coefficent applies to the model when the region is in the east atlantic.**

10. What information is missing here?

**- This excludes the information for when the answer is "No". In other words, we don't have a coefficient estimate for countries whose region is NOT east atlantic.**

You are essentially fitting two models (or $k$ models, where $k$ is the number of levels in your qualitative variable).
From your reading, you learned that R is creating an indicator variable (see p. 83).
If you have 3 levels in your qualitative variable, you would have 2 (3 - 1) indicator variables.
If you have $k$ levels in your qualitative variable, you would have $k - 1$ indicator variables.

The decision for R to call the indicator variable by one of your levels instead of the other has no deeper meaning.
R simply codes the level that comes first alphabetically with a $0$ for your indicator variable.
You can change this reference level of a categorical variable, which is the level that is coded as a 0, using the `relevel` function.
Use `?relevel` to learn more.

11. Write the estimated equation for your MLR model with a qualitative explanatory variable.

$$
\hat{y} = 4.38 + -0.102 \times eastAtlanticYes + .54 \times pf_expression_control
$$

12. Now, for each level of your qualitative variable, write the simplified equation of the estimated line for that level. Note that if your qualitative variable has two levels, you should have two simplified equations.

With Yes: 
$$
\hat{y} = 4.38 + -0.102 \times eastAtlanticYes + .54 \times pfExpressionControl
$$ 
With No: 
$$
\hat{y} = 4.38 + .54 \times pfExpressionControl
$$

The interpretation of the coefficients (parameter estimates) in multiple regression is slightly different from that of simple regression.
The estimate for the indicator variable reflects how much more a group is expected to be if something has that quality, *while holding all other variables constant*.
The estimate for the quantitative variable reflects how much change in the response variable occurs due to a 1-unit increase in the quantitative variable, *while holding all other variables constant*.

13. Interpret the parameter estimate for the reference level of your categorical variable in the context of your problem. Page 83 of the text can help here (or have me come chat with you).

**- For a country with all else held constant (in terms of expression control score), we expect that a country which IS in the eastAtlantic region to be .102 points lower in pf_score than otherwise.**

14. Interpret the parameter estimate for your quantitative variable in the context of your problem.

**- All else equal, we expect that a country with a one point higher expression control score will also have, on average, an associated increase of .54 in pf_score.**

## Challenge: Multiple levels

Below, create a new R code chunk (with a descriptive name) that fits a new model with the same response (`pf_score`) and quantitative explanatory variable (`pf_expression_control`), but now use a qualitative variable with more than two levels (say, `region`) and obtain the `tidy` model output.

```{r qual-mlr-multi-level}
# review any visual patterns
hfi_2016 %>% 
  select(pf_score, region, pf_expression_control) %>% #pick out our variables of interest for correlation matrices
  ggpairs()

#fit the mlr model to our data and predictors of interest (now region, categorical w/several levels)
qual_multi_mod <- lm_spec %>% 
  fit(pf_score ~ region + pf_expression_control, data = hfi_2016)

# model output
tidy(qual_multi_mod)
```

How does R appear to handle categorical variables with more than two levels?

**- It seems that R creates dummy variables for each level except 1 (k-1) for categorical predictors with multiple variables. It (i assume) takes the first alphabetical region name as the one left out - Caucusus and Central Asia here. This is the baseline - the treatment to which all other levels of the model compare to. Interpretations would read as "all else equal, a country from East Asia will have an estimated pf_score .5 higher than that of a country from the Caucusus and Central Asia region." The "all else equal" implies a set value of intercept (essentially the expected pf_score for a country with 0 expression control score and baseline region (Caucusus and Central Asia).) and pf_expression_control.**

# Day 3

We will explore a MLR model with an interaction between quantitative and qualitative explanatory variables as well as see some other methods to assess the fit of our model.
From the modeling process we came up with as a class, we will now address the "series of important questions that we should consider when performing multiple linear regression" (*ISL* [Section 3.2.2](https://hastie.su.domains/ISLR2/ISLRv2_website.pdf), p. 75):

1.  Is at least one of the $p$ predictors $X_1$, $X_2$, $\ldots$, $X_p$ useful in predicting the response $Y$?
2.  Do all the predictors help to explain $Y$, or is only a subset of the predictors useful?
3.  How well does the model fit the data?
4.  Given a set of predictor values, what response value should we predict and how accurate is our prediction?

Note that the text (*ISLR*) covers interactions between two quantitative explanatory variables as well.
By including an interaction term in our model, it may seem like we are relaxing the "additive assumption" a little.
However, the additive assumption is about the coefficients (the $\beta$s) and not the variables.

## Fitting the overall model with $qualitative \times quantitative$ interaction

Recall from Day 2 that you explored the model:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{qualitative\\_variable} + \beta_2 \times \text{quantitative\\_variable} + \varepsilon
$$

Today we will explore a similar model, except that also includes the interaction between your qualitative and quantitative explanatory variables.
That is,

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{qualitative\\_variable} + \beta_2 \times \text{quantitative\\_variable} + \beta_3 \times ( \text{qualitative\\_variable} \times \text{quantitative\\_variable}) + \varepsilon
$$

-   Run all previous code up to this point - you will need your prior dataset of just 2016 observations with the `east_atlantic` variable.
-   In the code chunk below titled `int-mlr`, replace "verbatim" with "r" just before the code chunk title.
-   Run your code chunk or knit your document.


```{r int-mlr}
# review any visual patterns
hfi_2016 %>% 
  select(pf_score, east_atlantic, pf_expression_control) %>% 
  ggpairs()

#fit the mlr model
lm_spec <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_mode("regression") %>%
  set_engine("lm")

int_mod <- lm_spec %>% 
  fit(pf_score ~ east_atlantic * pf_expression_control, data = hfi_2016)

# model output
tidy(int_mod)
```

Note that I shortened the model statement using `qualitative * quantitative`, but this can sometimes be confusing to read.
Another way to write the right-hand side of the equation is: `qualitative + quantitative + qualitative * quantitative`.

After doing this, answer the following question:

15. When viewing the `tidy` output, notice that the interaction term is listed as `qualitativelevel:quantitative`.
    Referring back to Day 2 with how R displays qualitative variables, interpret what this syntax means.

**-   This means that the provided coefficient estimate applies to the countries in east atlantic region (east_atlanticYes) interacting with the pf_expression_control score. This roughly means that there seems to be an especially pronounced increase in the positive effect of pf_expression_control on pf_score, under the condition that the country belongs to the east atlantic region.**


16. Using page 100 of *ISLR* as a reference, if needed, and your work from Day 2, write the simplified equation of the line corresponding to each level of your qualitative explanatory variable.

With Yes: 
$$
\hat{y} = 5.72 - 1.599 + .296 \times pfExpressionControl + .275 
$$ 
With No: 
$$
\hat{y} = 5.72 + .296 \times pfExpressionControl 
$$
**-   These equations can be viewed as the estimates of pf_score under the two possible conditions for our binary predictor variable (east_atlantic). The coefficients are "turned on" in the 'Yes' case, and "off" in the 'No' case. Since the value is binary (0 or 1), we can simply write the lines such that the coefficients are multiplied by 1 (or left as is), or excluded entirely, because they've been multiplied by 0.**


17. For two observations with similar values of the quantitative , which level tends to have higher values of the response variable?

**-   For two observations with similar values of the quantitative variable, we expect the obsevations with "No" for east_atlantic to have a higher pf_score. **

18. Like you did in Day 1, assess the fit of this model (no need to do any formal hypothesis testing - we will explore this next).
    How does `int_mod`'s fit compare to `mlr_mod`?
    What did you use to compare these?
    Why?

```{r}
#need to find measure of model fit code in activity 2
```


Recall our brief discussion on how many disciplines are moving away from $p$-values in favor of other methods.
We will explore $p$-values these other methods later this semester, but we will practice our classical methods here.
This is known as an "overall $F$ test" and the hypotheses are:

That (the null) no predictors are useful for the model (i.e., all slopes are equal to zero) versus the alternative that at least one predictor is useful for the model (i.e., at least one slope is not zero).
One way to check this is to build our null model (no predictors) and then compare this to our candidate model (`int_mod`).

-   In the code chunk below titled `mod-comp`, replace "verbatim" with "r" just before the code chunk title.

```{verbatim mod-comp}
# null model
null_mod <- lm_spec %>% 
fit(response ~ 1, data = data)

anova(
  extract_fit_engine(int_mod),
  extract_fit_engine(null_mod)
)
```

19. Using your background knowledge of $F$ tests, what is the $F$ test statistic and $p$-value for this test? Based on an $\alpha = 0.05$ significant level, what should you conclude?

## Partial slope test - do all predictors help explain $y$?

Assuming that your overall model is significant (at least one predictor is useful), we will continue on.
Continue through these next tasks even if your overall model was not significant.

We could do a similar process to fit a new model while removing one explanatory variable at at time, and using `anova` to compare these models.
However, the `tidy` output also helps here (the `statistic` and `p.value` columns).

For each slope, you are testing if that slope is zero (when including the other variables, the null) or if it is not zero (when including the other variables, the alternative).
Because the interaction term is a combination of the other two variables, we should assess the first.

20. What is the $t$ test statistic and $p$-value associated with this test? Based on an $\alpha = 0.05$ significant level, what should you conclude?

If your interaction term was not significant, you could consider removing it.
Now look at your two non-interaction terms...

21. What are the $t$ test statistic and $p$-value associated with these tests? Based on an $\alpha = 0.05$ significant level, what should you conclude about these two predictors?

You would not need to do (21) if the interaction was significant.
You also should not remove a main variable (non-interaction variable) if the interaction variable remains in your model.

## Residual assessment - how well does the model fit the data?

You have already done this step in past activities by exploring your residuals (Activity 2).
Using your final model from Task 3, assess how well your model fits the data.
